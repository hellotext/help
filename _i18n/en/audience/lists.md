Lists are the simplest way to organize contacts and subscribers. 

Lists are convenient when you are just starting or if the number of subscribers in them will remain low.

## Create a list

From the *Audience* section click on the <img src="/images/icons/add.svg" class="avatar-icon bg-blush" width="25" /> button near the bottom right of the page and select *New List*.

You must enter a unique name for the list. 

Click on the *Save changes* button when you are done to confirm the creation.

## Adding contacts to a list

There are two easy ways to add a contact into a list. 

If you are on a conversation, you can click on the three dots near the contact info and select *Edit*. A pane will open on the right side with the contact properties to edit. 

When clicking on the field *Lists* the list of existing lists will appear. You can select as many as you want. 

Click on *Save changes* to confirm the changes. 

The contact now belongs to the lists you selected. To make sure this is the case, visit the List's contacts page, by navigating to the *Audience* section and click on the list name on the left side. The contact should be visible inside the list. 

Another quick way to add contacts into lists is from the *Audience* section by simply clicking on the three dots on the right of each contact and select the lists you want the contact to be in. To remove a contact from a list you can click again to remove it from the list.

## Renaming a list

From the *Audience* section simply point over the list title that you want to rename over the left side of the page.

An edit icon will be visible on its right. Click on the icon. A pane will be opened on the right side.

Rename the title and click on *Save Changes*.

## Removing a list

Removing a list only removes the list itself and does not remove the contacts themselves that it may contain.

From the *Audience* section simply point over the list title that you want to remove over the left side of the page.

An edit icon will be visible on its right. Click on the icon. A pane will be opened on the right side.

Click on the trash icon near the bottom right area of the pane. 

A confirmation dialog will ask you to confirm the list deletion.

Click on *Delete* to confirm the action.
