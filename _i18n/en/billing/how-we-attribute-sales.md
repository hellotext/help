At Hellotext we design our pricing model so that the growth of your e‑commerce business is reflected directly in the results you pay for. That’s why the way we attribute sales is crafted to ensure you only pay for what truly generates revenue through our platform.

## Attribution Model: Last Click Non‑Direct

**Last Click Non‑Direct**: We attribute a sale only when the customer reaches your store **via Hellotext** (WhatsApp or SMS).

If the purchase originated from another source (Meta, Google, email, etc.), we detect the overlap and **cancel the attribution**.

## Attribution Window

**1. Initial Impact**
When you send a message to a customer with a short link to your e‑commerce site, a **24‑hour** window opens during which that interaction can generate a sale.

**2. Automatic Extension**
If the user clicks the link within those 24 hours, we extend the window on that device for an additional **7 days**.

With this mechanism you can be sure that only sales that stem from an impact made through Hellotext are counted as attributable.

## Scenarios in Which We Do Not Attribute Sales

* **Sales not generated by Hellotext**: any purchase that did not receive a direct impact via the platform.
* **Links sent by your team**: links (including short links) that your team distributes directly in conversations.
* **Manually created events**: follow‑up or sales recording actions that you set up manually outside of Hellotext.
* **Unconfirmed, canceled, or returned orders**: we attribute only confirmed orders and exclude returns.
