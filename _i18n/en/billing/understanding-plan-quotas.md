## What we measure each month

We apply a single rule: you pay only the highest amount among these four items for the month (they are not added together):

1. **Plan minimum**
2. **Performance fee** (**2–5%**) on attributed revenue
3. **SMS costs** (depending on country/plan)
4. **Variable messaging fee** (**US$ 2/1,000**) — only if it is higher than the other three

## Billing components

### 1) Performance fee (2–5%)

% applied to sales attributable to Hellotext messages/channels within the current window. Plan breakpoints: **3%** from **US$ 2,500** (Small), **2%** from **US$ 15,000** (Grow), **1%** from **US$ 250,000** (Enterprise).

> **Attribution (updated rule):** *last non‑direct click*; 24 h per impacted phone; 7 days if the shopper clicks your short link on the same device; excludes manual entries, sales not tied to Hellotext, and purchases in conversations handled by a human.

### 2) Multichannel AI messages (fair‑use)

Included at no extra cost when **plan minimum**, **performance %**, or **SMS** are higher than the variable fee. If all are lower, US$ 2 per 1,000 messages applies. Never both: we bill the highest.

### 3) SMS by country

Per‑message costs in local currency; they follow the “pay only the highest” rule. See the table in [Pricing explanation](https://www.hellotext.com/precios#sms) for current values.

### 4) Plan minimum

Monthly minimum for the plan. If the other items are lower, you pay the minimum; if any one is higher, you pay that.

## Billing formula

*Monthly Hellotext charge = max { Plan minimum, Performance fee,
SMS costs, Variable fee (US$ 2/1,000) }*

<div class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> the variable fee only applies if it is the highest for the month; it is not added to any other item. 
</div>

## Calculation examples

**Scenario 1: Month with strong performance (Starter)**

* Attributed revenue: **US$ 2,000** → 5% = **US$ 100**
* Multichannel messages: **10,000** → **US$ 20** (variable)
* SMS: **US$ 0**
* Floor: **US$ 0**
  **You pay Hellotext:** **US$ 100** (highest). **WhatsApp (Meta):** billed separately.

**Scenario 2: Low performance and high volume month (Small)**

* Performance %: **US$ 30**
* Multichannel messages: **50,000** → **US$ 100** (variable)
* SMS: **US$ 0**
* Small floor: **US$ 74**
  **You pay Hellotext:** **US$ 100** (the variable is the highest).

**Scenario 3: SMS dominates**

* Performance %: **US$ 60**
* Multichannel messages: **40,000** → **US$ 80** (variable)
* **SMS: US$ 150**
* Small floor: **US$ 74**
  **You pay Hellotext:** **US$ 150** (SMS). *Variable does not apply.*

**Scenario 4: Floor dominates**

* Performance %: **US$ 0**
* Multichannel messages: **10,000** → **US$ 20** (variable)
* SMS: **US$ 0**
* **Small floor: US$ 74**
  **You pay Hellotext:** **US$ 74** (floor). *Variable does not apply.*

## How to read your invoice

* **Billed item:** you will see one of the four (floor / performance / SMS / variable fee).
* **WhatsApp (Meta):** appears on your Meta invoice, not on Hellotext’s.
* **Volume detail:** the activity panel shows messages sent and attributed revenue for the period.

## Frequently asked questions

**Which sales are considered “attributable”?**

Those where Hellotext was the last non‑direct click before purchase, within 24 h per impacted phone, or 7 days if the shopper clicked your short link on the same device. We do not count manual entries, sales not tied to Hellotext, and purchases in conversations handled by humans.

**Where can I see SMS rates and available countries?**

In the SMS rates by country table in [Pricing explanation](https://www.hellotext.com/precios).

They are charged in local currency and follow the highest‑only rule.

**What does each plan include besides price?**

Members, playbooks access, support levels, and activity history, plus advanced features on higher plans (Grow/Enterprise).
