If you have a store on the Wix platform, you can easily connect it to Hellotext.

By connecting your Wix store, you will be able to track all your customers' activities, automatically creating profiles with their data and feeding them with their activities.

The following activities are automatically tracked:

* Abandoned carts
* Cart updates
* Applied coupons
* Completed orders
* Updated orders

With this information, you can create segmented audiences and much more effective promotional campaigns.

## Connect your Wix site

From the Hellotext dashboard, go to the *Settings* section and click on *Integrations*.

## Next steps

From now on, you will start seeing your customers' activities reflected in the Audience section or the Inbox.

You can click on each profile to see the activity history they perform on your eCommerce site.

With this information, you can create segments for campaign sending and automations from the Routes section.
