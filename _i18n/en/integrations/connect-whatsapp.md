With Hellotext you can connect a new or existing WhatsApp account to manage all your customer conversations in one place, send targeted campaigns and create automations.

This is a step-by-step guide to help you set up your WhatsApp account with Hellotext.

## Before you start

Before you start make sure about the following:

#### You have a Facebook account with access to your company Meta Business Suite.
* You’ll need to sign in to your Facebook account in the next steps. If you do not have a Facebook account you can [**create one here**](https://www.facebook.com/reg/) first.
* If your company doesn't have a Meta Business account, make sure to [**create one here**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347).
* Make sure you have admin access to your company’s Meta Business account.

#### You have an available phone number to use for WhatsApp.
* You can use a phone number already registered with WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business. If you do so, you must first delete their WhatsApp account [**following these instructions**](https://faq.whatsapp.com/3059780464322392/). Please note that any existing conversation will be deleted and they will not be recoverable. If you want to keep your conversations we suggest using a new phone number.
* If you already have a WhatsApp Business Platform account (already connected to similar service to Hellotext) you will be likely able to proceed without the account deletion. However any existing conversation will not be imported.
* You must be able to receive SMS or phone calls in this phone number.
* You can use Hellotext’s acquired phone numbers or acquire a new phone number if you don’t have one already.

## Next Steps

#### Associate a payment method on WhatsApp

In order to be able to send messages to your customers you need to set up a payment method on Meta. You can associate a credit card or a credit line if you are already using Meta Ads to your new WhatsApp Account 

Visit the [**Meta WhatsApp Manager**](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/) page from the WhatsApp account you want to associate a payment method, select the three dots and click on *Manage account settings*.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/payment-method-1.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

From the WhatsApp account Settings page click on *Payment Settings*.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/payment-method-2.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

From *Payment methods* click on *Add payment method*.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/payment-method-3.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

Select your business country, currency and time zone and click on *Next*.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/payment-method-4.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

Select your preferred payment method (availability depends on your country) and click on *Next*.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/payment-method-5.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

Enter your payment information and click on *Save*.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/payment-method-6.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

The credit card is added to your WhatsApp Business Platform account. You can view the added credit card in the Settings tab.

If you need more help, you can [**follow these official Meta instructions**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/488291839463771#) and you can learn more about billing for your WhatsApp Business account [**here**](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2225184664363779?id=2129163877102343).

#### Verify your business

You need to verify your business on Meta if you haven't already.

Visit the [**Meta Business Settings**](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/) page and from the left side click on *Security Center*.

From the Verification area click on *Start verification* and follow the steps. You'll be asked for your company information and Meta may request some information about your business as well as additional legal documents.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/verification-1.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

This process can take severals days while Meta reviews your documentation so we recommend to start it as early as possible to increase your sending limits and to prevent Meta deactivating your WhatsApp account.

#### How to get a green badge <img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/badge.png" width="20" style="display: inline-block;" /> on WhatsApp 

<p>Once your account is verified, you can apply for a green badge in your WhatsApp Business Account. This is recommended as it increases trust and gives reassurance to customers that they are communicating with your business.</p>

<div class="note">
  Before you apply to a green badge you need to have a WhatsApp Business Account created with at least one verified phone number, a payment method associated to your WhatsApp Business Account and you need to complete your business verification.
</div>

Visit the [**Meta WhatsApp Manager**](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/home/), click on *Account tools* and select *Phone numbers*.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/green-badge-1.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

Click on the settings icon of the desired phone number you want to obtain a badge.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/green-badge-2.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

Click on *Profile* and from Official business account click on *Submit request* and follow the steps.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/green-badge-3.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />
   
If Submit request is disabled make sure first that you have added a payment method to your WhatsApp Business Account and you have your business already verified.

## Troubleshooting

#### Can't add a payment method

If your WhatsApp Business Platform Account was previusly associated to a different provider and the provider was a BSP (managed the payments) it may be required that your service provider removes the line of credit from your account before you can add yours. 

You can ask your previous service provider to remove your line of credit from your account before attempting again.

## Common Questions

#### I need to pay both to Meta and Hellotext?

Yes. Hellotext charges a flat 2 credits per any conversation initiated either by a customer or by you. A conversation is opened for 24 hours and during this period all the messages in the conversation have no charge.

Meta typically gives you a certain number of customer initiated free of charge and also charges per every conversation you initiate. Rates vary from country to country. We suggest checking our [**Pricing**](https://www.hellotext.com/pricing) page to see the latest prices Meta charges for a business-initiated WhatsApp conversation in your country. 

To see the latest price, from the *Credits* row click on *See table*.

These costs generated by Meta are paid directly to Meta by you with the payment method you associated to your WhatsApp Business Account.

#### Is the charge per business or per conversation?

Hellotext and Meta do not charge per messages but rather per conversation. A conversation is opened for 24 hours and during this period all the messages in the conversation have no charge.

#### What are the sending limits?

Meta monitors the quality of the messages you send to your customers. 

Meta typically begins allowing 250 business initiated conversations during a 24-hour window and it increases to 1,000 once you verify your business. 

We recommend to check your quality rating often and make sure you rating is high. 

To see the quality of your WhatsApp Business Account numbers visit the [**Phone numbers**](https://business.facebook.com/wa/manage/phone-numbers) section.

<img src="images/integrations/whatsapp/en/quality-rating.jpeg" alt="" width="768" />

If you maintain your quality rating high Meta will increase the number of messages you can send every 24 hour to 10,000, 100,000 or unlimited. 

You can get more information about the current messaging limits of each of your phone numbers by clicking on the *Settings* icon.
