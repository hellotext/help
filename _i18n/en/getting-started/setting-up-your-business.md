You will be asked to select the plan that best fits your business. 

All plans include a 30-day free trial period.

You will be asked to enter a credit card to activate your plan. You will not be charged during the trial period. 

If you prefer to skip the credit and plan to make payments via bank deposits, choose *Wire deposit* instead and continue.

Newly created businesses are always invoiced under a prepaid agreement. This means that in order to activate you trial you need to make a refundable deposit first.

Businesses with invoicing agreement as *credit* can activate a trial without a bank deposit.

Get creative and think of a sticky message that you can send to your customers. A discount on their next purchase? A link to a new product announcement? Some old inventory to clear? The possibilities and opportunities to increase sales and drive more engagement are endless.

You can also narrow your campaigns to specific targeted audiences using *Segments*.
