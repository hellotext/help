## What is Hellotext?

Hellotext is an AI-powered conversational automation platform designed to help eCommerce businesses sell more without relying on manual message sending.

Connect your store, and Hellotext takes care of the rest: it detects sales opportunities, sends personalized messages through WhatsApp, SMS, or Instagram, and measures the real impact on your revenue.

You can think of it as a sales autopilot that works day and night, keeping your brand’s tone and holding conversations that convert.

## What channels can I use?

Hellotext operates on the channels where your customers already are: WhatsApp, Instagram Direct, Facebook Messenger, Webchat, MercadoLibre, and SMS.

Messages sent via WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook Messenger, or Webchat are covered under the fair-use policy; SMS messages are billed separately depending on country and plan. This way, you can combine channels without worrying about unexpected costs.

## What are AI agents?

Every action in Hellotext — checking an order, recommending a product, recovering a cart, or answering a question — is handled by a specialized agent.

These agents are small intelligences that understand user intent (for example: *“I want to know my shipment”*) and act automatically.

Some examples:

* **Transactional agents:** order tracking, returns, shipping status.
* **Decision agents:** product recommendations or upselling.
* **Support agents:** responses to FAQs.
* **Enrichment agents:** capture missing data (“What’s your size?”).
* **Guardrails:** ensure tone, privacy, and compliance.
* **Predictors:** optimize send time or detect abandonment risk.
* **Escalators:** hand off to a human when needed.

Together, these agents allow your business to serve, recommend, and sell automatically — always with human-level judgment.

## What are playbooks?

Playbooks are prebuilt automations that combine business logic with AI to create complete experiences.
For example:

* *Abandoned Cart* recovers forgotten carts.
* *Browse Recovery* reconnects with visitors who didn’t buy.
* *Back-in-Stock* alerts customers when a product returns.
* *VIP Club* nurtures your best customers.
* *Order Update + AI Support* informs and assists during delivery.

Each playbook has a base flow (when, to whom, and with what limits) that AI personalizes according to behavior, purchase history, and context. It’s a simple, effective way to keep campaigns always active and sounding human.

## Can I keep manual control over what the AI does?

Yes. Hellotext doesn’t replace your judgment — it amplifies it.

You can review and approve messages, adjust text or discounts, pause campaigns, or activate manual mode whenever needed.

The system even explains why it takes each decision (“Because you…”), allowing you to learn from and trust the AI without losing visibility or control.

## How does Hellotext avoid sending too many messages or at the wrong times?

The platform includes a Communications Governor (CG), a “governor” that regulates the message flow for each customer.
This system applies:

* **Quiet hours** (configurable silent periods).
* **Frequency limits** by category (promotions, service, reminders).
* **Deduplication** across campaigns.
* **Channel prioritization** (chooses the most effective medium for each context).

Everything also passes through Guardrails for tone and compliance, and through STO (Send-Time Optimization), which calculates the best send time based on customer behavior.

## What is Send-Time Optimization (STO)?

STO is one of Hellotext’s most powerful intelligences.

It analyzes each contact’s open and response habits and selects a 30-minute window where the conversion probability is highest.

You can schedule your sends or let STO distribute them automatically for maximum performance.

## How does performance-based pricing work?

Hellotext doesn’t charge you for using the tool, but for the results it generates.

You pay a percentage (2 – 5%) of the sales attributed to Hellotext, plus a monthly plan based on your stage.

Each month, the “pay once” rule applies: you only pay the highest among:

* your plan value,
* the performance fee, or
* the variable message cost (US $2 per 1,000 messages).

You never pay more than one of these in the same month. **[More about Pricing](/how-pricing-works)**.

## What counts as an attributed sale?

Hellotext attributes a sale only when it was the last non-direct click before purchase.

Attribution remains valid:

* **24 hours** after a received message (for the impacted phone), or
* **7 days** if the buyer clicks a Hellotext short link on the same device.

Sales entered manually or conversations resolved by human agents are not counted.

You can learn more about **[how we attribute sales](/how-we-attribute-sales)**.

## Are AI messages unlimited?

In practice, yes. As long as the performance fee exceeds message costs, there’s no extra charge.

If in a given month performance is lower, a symbolic fee of US $2 per additional 1,000 messages applies.

The idea is that your investment grows only when your sales do.

## Do I also have to pay Meta for WhatsApp?

Yes. WhatsApp Business conversation rates are billed directly by Meta and are not included in your Hellotext invoice.

You can check updated rates on the **[official Meta site](https://business.whatsapp.com/products/platform-pricing#rates)**.

## What plans exist?

Hellotext adapts to every growth stage:

* **Starter (Free):** ideal to start and test.
* **Small (US $74/month):** includes AI and basic automations.
* **Grow (US $299/month):** designed for higher-volume teams.
* **Enterprise:** custom plan with 24/7 support.

The performance fee decreases as your sales grow (5% → 3% → 2%).

## How much history is kept?

Depends on the plan:

* **Starter:** 2 months
* **Small:** 6 months
* **Grow / Enterprise:** full history under retention policy.

## How do I capture and update my contacts?

You can import lists (CSV or integrations) and generate new contacts with widgets, links, or QR codes.

Hellotext also automatically enriches profiles with conversational data such as size, preferences, or location — making every message more relevant and human.

## What platforms does it integrate with?

Hellotext easily connects with your eCommerce, CRM, and logistics tools.

It also supports custom HTTP requests and webhooks to automate shipments, sync inventory, or create advanced reports.

## How does Hellotext protect my brand’s privacy and tone?

Before each send, the Guardrails module analyzes and adjusts the message to comply with privacy laws, avoid sensitive language, and maintain consistency with your brand identity.

The system also enforces opt-in/opt-out, quiet hours, and frequency limits — ensuring ethical, respectful conversations.

## Can I send scheduled or instant campaigns?

Yes. You can plan sends with a specific date and time or launch them instantly.

The AI can also determine the best send time for each customer, balancing performance and experience.

## What kind of reports does Hellotext offer?

The main dashboard clearly shows your results:

* Generated and attributed revenue.
* Performance by channel and playbook.
* Click, conversion, and opt-out rates.
* Alerts, anomalies, and actionable insights.

All within an interactive Revenue Funnel that shows where you’re winning and where you can improve.

## What happens if a customer replies or data is missing?

Hellotext uses an intelligent micro-delegation system: if an agent needs extra information, it asks a single question, saves the answer, and continues the original flow.

Example: “Could you tell me your order number?” → saves it → resumes tracking without restarting the conversation.

## How is a conversation escalated to a human?

If the AI detects confusion, frustration, or off-policy topics, it executes escalate.human and transfers the conversation to a real agent.

The complete history and context are preserved so the human agent can continue seamlessly without losing information.

## What support levels does Hellotext offer?

* **Starter:** email support (~24h response).
* **Small:** priority email or WhatsApp support (~8h).
* **Grow:** dedicated account manager (~4h).
* **Enterprise:** full 24/7 support with priority response.

## How do I get started?

1. Connect your store (Shopify, VTEX, WooCommerce, etc.).
2. Activate your first playbooks, like *Welcome* or *Cart Saver*.
3. Customize your messages and watch your first attributed sales appear.

Hellotext handles the rest — AI, timing, and optimization. From day one, your dashboard shows results, metrics, and improvement suggestions.
