Using QR codes to subscribe to SMS messaging can be a useful tool for eCommerce, retail and consumer packaged goods (CPG) industries.

Here are some examples of how QR codes can be used in these contexts:

* A clothing store could display QR codes in their store or on their website, allowing customers to easily subscribe to receive updates on new arrivals, sales, and special promotions via SMS.
* A physical store could display QR codes next to products or in their weekly flyer, allowing customers to subscribe to receive notifications about new product releases, discounts via SMS.
* A CPG company could include QR codes on product packaging, allowing customers to subscribe to receive updates about the product, such as usage tips, recipes, or special offers via SMS.

### How does it work

When a customer scans the QR code, they will be taken to the native SMS app on their phone with a pre-filled, customizable text message and the number to subscribe to. 

All they need to do is press *Send* to become subscribed to your business. This is a convenient and efficient way for customers to subscribe to receive text announcements from your business, as they don't have to manually enter their phone number. 

Scanning the QR code with their phone is all it takes to quickly and easily subscribe.

## Creating a QR Code

To set up a QR code, go to the *Captures* section and click on *New capture method*. Then, select *QR code*. 

If you have phone numbers or short codes associated with your business, you can choose one of these as the number that customers will send the opt-in message to. 

If you don't have a preference or don't have any numbers associated with your business, you can use the default settings and Hellotext will choose the most appropriate number for you. 

You can also customize the pre-filled message that customers will send to subscribe.

### Assigning coupons and journeys

On the next step, you have the option to choose what happens after your customer subscribes.

By default, a welcome message is sent to the subscriber. 

However, if you have created any coupons, you can choose to include them in the welcome message as an incentive for subscribing. 

Alternatively, you can select a journey that you have created to replace the default welcome message. 

This journey will be sent to the subscriber instead of the default message.

### Get the QR Code

Once you're finished, you can move on to the next step to download your QR code in SVG format. 

SVG is a vector format, which means that your QR code will always look great, whether it's used in printed materials, packaging, or online. 

To test your QR code, simply point your phone camera at the QR code on your screen.
