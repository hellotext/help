When inviting your team to join your business on Hellotext you may want to limit how much access he has and to limit his privileges to what is most relevant to his responsibilities.

For this we propose different team member roles. Not everyone needs to see everything and by setting the the correct role you make sure that most sensitive parts are available only for the appropriate team members.
